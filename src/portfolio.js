    "As the world increasingly runs on software, I believe true innovation happens when software and hardware merge seamlessly. With a passion for electronics, embedded systems, and robotics, I‚Äôm focused on developing skills at the intersection of firmware, AI/ML, and hardware integration.\n\nAt Texas Tech University, I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience with microcontrollers, PCB design, robotics projects, and system integration. My goal is to contribute to technologies that power autonomous systems, smart devices, and advanced communications.\n\nI‚Äôm actively seeking internship opportunities in embedded systems, firmware development, robotics, and communications engineering ‚Äî connecting innovation with impact."
